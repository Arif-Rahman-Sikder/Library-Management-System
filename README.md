# Library-Management-System
This library management system project was completed for our third semester final exam. This project demonstrates how to handle a large library and how a person may issue books and learn from them. I worked on this project with Adib, one of my university classmates. I created the first foundation in Netbeans, and Adib assisted me in inserting data into the database using SQL.
